## We burn, but we burn with care.

Welcome to BurnWithCare project. 

This project is designed for drawing some consideration towards the use of incense and joss paper.



### Background Information

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense">Incense</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_paper">joss paper</a> are commonly used in Chinese religious and ritual practice. However, due to the massive burning of these products, damage could be caused towards environment and health. This project is meant for inspiring the majority users of incense and joss paper based on how to use these products effectively, eco-friendly and healthily. One thing need to be addressed is that this project never intend to challenge the culture and tradition of related territories and ethnic groups.

### What do scholars think?
<p>There are peer reviewed journal articles on this subject. They are mostly from a health-concerned point of view. However, we are not going to analyze any articles here, what we are gonna do is showing you some most frequently used terms in three most sited articles from UVIC library database, see results below.</p>

<p>As you can see clearly terms such as lung, risk and environment are frequently used in these articles, regardless expected terms like incense and religion.</p>

<p>Now, let's see what's the case for joss paper.</p>

<p>As you can see, the health and environment issue is concerned by scholars. 
  
<P>But still, what if people still want to burn joss paper?
  It is a cultural phenomena, something we cannot simply eliminate.
  Therefore, a joss paper burning site could be considered, see image below.</p>

<p>This is a concept map of joss paper buring side. Basically, there should be good air circulation, available fire extinguishers.</p>

<p>A concept super cemetery which include stores selling goods for mourning, such as flowers, food and drinks, alcohol and tobacco.</p>
<p>Assuming such super cemetery exist, before you visit, would you like to take a few minutes for a <a href="http://philome.la/VincentVastur/joss-paper-testing">questionnaire</a> </p>

 ### What do we do in the future?
 <p>Instead of challenging culture and tradition, perhaps we should be careful when using incense and joss paper.</p>
 <p>Consider these questions:</p>

 <p>Do I really need to burn that much incense and joss paper?
    Can I just burn these incense and joss paper anywhere I wish?
    What do these incense and joss paper made of?</p>
    
   <p>This is not a call out. Instead, just trigger some thoughts upon how do we deal with traditional culture practice.
